This project is a simple iOS implementation of the slider puzzle otherwise known as Mystic Squares, the 15-puzzle, Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of Fifteen and apparently many others(1). 

I am writing this simulation as open source under the MIT license (2) I plan to use it later as the beginning of a larger opengl es puzzle game. 

The base architecture of this project is a slightly modified template from Beginning iPhone Game Development, chapters 6-8, by Ben Britton.  

I am using the fixed graphics pipeline available through the opengl es v1.1 because this version is currently supported by the largest number of mobile iOS devices. 

This is quickly changing though so I will eventually transition to the new standards for opengl es 2.0 set in iOS 5 and greater. 

I am still working on the collider logic but hope to have this sorted out very soon. I am also working on a quick algorithm to solve the puzzle; ether through an implementation of NP-hard or perhaps the hamiltonian path.

If you have any comments for me please feel free to leave it and feel free to submit any enhancements you have made and wouldn't mind sharing. Happy Coding!

Thanks,
Michael
