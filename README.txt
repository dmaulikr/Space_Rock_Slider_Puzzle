Space_Rock_Slider_Puzzle


This project is a simple iOS implementation of the slider puzzle otherwise known as Mystic Squares, the 15-puzzle, Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of Fifteen and apparently many others(1). 

I am building this project for a programming challenge suggested by a third party, but am interested in the mathematics of this game as well and it's relationship to the NP-hard problem in complexity theory. 

The base architecture of this project is a modified template from Beginning iPhone Game Development, chapters 6-8, by Ben Britton Smith. I bought his book and enjoyed his tutorials and talks. 

I am using this foundation as a convenience because the quickest way to get maximum performance and device range is to use opengl es 1.1. The meat of this project is mostly in the Tile object where I work out all the collision logic and UI elements. I am sharing this project under the MIT license.(2)

If you have any comments or suggestions, please feel free to contact me at this @ contact.us@norobostudios.com.

Thanks,
Michael
