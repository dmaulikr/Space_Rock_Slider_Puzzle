Space_Rock_Slider_Puzzle


This project is a simple iOS implementation of the slider puzzle otherwise known as Mystic Squares, the 15-puzzle, Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of Fifteen and apparently many others(1). 

I am interested in the mathematics of this game as well as the challenge of building it for a touch interface mobile device. Finding an optimal solution to this puzzle is NP hard and building this app gives me the opportunity to experiment with various optimization algorithms in the future. 

this program is still not perfect and has a bug related to the collision detection and tile position verification. I will continue to working on this in my spare time.

If you have any comments or suggestions, please feel free to contact me at contact.us@norobostudios.com.

Thanks!
