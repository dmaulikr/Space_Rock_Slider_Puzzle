Space_Rock_Slider_Puzzle


This project is a simple iOS implementation of the slider puzzle otherwise known as Mystic Squares, the 15-puzzle, Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of Fifteen and apparently many others(1). 

I am building this project for a programming challenge suggested by a third party, but am also interested in the mathematics of this game as well because finding an optimal solution to this puzzle is NP hard and building this app give me the opportunity to experiment. 

I am using a very simple opengl es game architecture as a convenience because the quickest way to get maximum performance and device range is to use opengl es 1.1. 

The meat of this project is mostly in the Tile object where I work out all the collision logic and UI elements, but I am also pleased with the the sprite rendering and ordering methods. 

If you have any comments or suggestions, please feel free to contact me at this @ contact.us@norobostudios.com.

Thanks!

Michael
